# Basic info about Julia

I put the notebooks presented today. 
- In [julia_zygote.ipynb](julia_zygote.ipynb)  you will have the automatic differentiation stuff presented today (the Linear Regression from scratch).
- In [arraBroadcasting.ipynb](arraBroadcasting.ipynb) there is the"brief" intro to Julia.
- In [ViewFactors.ipynb](ViewFactors.ipynb) there is a viewFactors computations done in Julia, with some benchmarking.

Some extra links:
- The [julia site](https://julialang.org) is a good starting point.
